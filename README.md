# Leetcode_Solution
Author : Aditya Kapse
Short description
A curated collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in three languages: C++, Java, and Python. Each problem entry includes a clear problem statement (link to LeetCode), one or more language implementations, time & space complexity, and brief explanation or approach notes.

Features
Multi-language implementations: C++, Java, and Python solutions for each problem.
Organized by problem & difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard folders or tags.
Consistent file naming: Problem number and title in filenames (e.g., 0001-two-sum.py, 0001-two-sum.cpp, 0001-two-sum.java).
Explanations: 
Short approach, reasoning, and complexity analysis alongside code.
Test samples: Inline sample inputs/outputs or simple main/test harness for local verification.
Contributor-friendly: Contribution guidelines and templates for adding new solutions.
