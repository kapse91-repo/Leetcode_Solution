# Leetcode_Solution
Author : Aditya Kapse  <br>
Short description     <br>
A curated collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in three languages: C++, Java, and Python. Each problem entry includes a clear problem statement (link to LeetCode), one or more language implementations, time & space complexity, and brief explanation or approach notes.   <br>

Features   <br>
Multi-language implementations: C++, Java, and Python solutions for each problem.   <br>
Organized by problem & difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard folders or tags.   <br>
Consistent file naming: Problem number and title in filenames (e.g., 0001-two-sum.py, 0001-two-sum.cpp, 0001-two-sum.java).   <br>
Explanations:   <br>
Short approach, reasoning, and complexity analysis alongside code.   <br>
Test samples: Inline sample inputs/outputs or simple main/test harness for local verification.   <br>
Contributor-friendly: Contribution guidelines and templates for adding new solutions.   <br>
